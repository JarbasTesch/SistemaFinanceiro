# Financial and Employee Management System - CRUD Application

This system was developed during my internship at Instituto Beija-Flor to meet the demand for better financial and employee management. It provides the ability to create, read, update, and delete both employees and extra expenses (such as unforeseen costs). 

Additionally, the system can generate a PDF report containing the following details:
- **Current balance:** Total cash available.
- **Total planned expenses:** Total amount to be spent.
- **Remaining balance:** Remaining amount after payments.
- **Employee information:** Name, position, department, and payment details.
- **Extra expenses:** Description of the expense and its value.

The system also includes a **"PAYMENT" button**, which calculates the total expenses, updates the database, clears extra expenses, and starts a new month by retaining only the recurring payments for registered employees.
